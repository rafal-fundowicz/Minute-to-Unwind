# Minute to Unwind

[Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)) implementation I always wanted but never found.

Solve puzzles endlessly, without pressure. No move counting, no trying to complete them all. Just chill.

You can save difficult or interesting puzzles for later and go back to any completed ones. And everything is stored at all times, so you can always pick up right where you left off.

Play now on [my webpage](https://fundowicz.com) or download current builds from [itch.io](https://rafal-fundowicz.itch.io/minute-to-unwind).
